    <h1>Ingerence in CSPs</h1>

    <p>We can be solve CSPs using two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search Algorithm</li>
        <li>Inference: constraint propagation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Consistency</h2>
    <p>Each variable is a node in a graph. 
        The value set by a variable cause the elimination of 
        inconsistent value throught the graph</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Node Consistency: a single variable is node-consistent if all 
            the values in the variable's domain satisfy the variable's unary
            constraint. 
            
            A graph is node-consistent if every variable in the 
            graph is node-consistent. N.B. All n-ary constraints can be 
            transform into binary constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arc Consistency: a variable is arc-consistent if every value 
            in its domain satisfies the variable's binary constraints.
            X_i is arc-consistency with respect to another variable X_j if
            for every value in current domain D_i there is some value in 
            the domain D_j that satisfies the binary constraint on the 
            arc (X_i, X_j).
            
            A graph is arc-consistent if every variable is arc-consistent
            with every other variable.

            The algorithm AC-3 make every variable arc-consistent. The 
            arc-consistent CSP will in most cases be faster to search 
            because its variables have smaller domains.
